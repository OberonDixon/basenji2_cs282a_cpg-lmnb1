### Training the transformer

train_basenji_transformer.ipynb contains code for training. You will need the embeddings.h5 file and the dataset_14-lmnb1_4-cpg.h5 file downloaded to your machine, or alternatively, you can use the loading-from-cloud approach in cs282a_linear-probing. See the top level readme for download instructions.

Top level requirements.txt should contain relevant dependencies.
